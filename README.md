### Description Setara :
We focuses on helping deaf people. We hope that this application can help deaf people to rise up and improve themselves. We want to show deaf people that we are all equal and that they can also get a decent job.

Therefore, we created a mobile application that contains self-improvement educational videos. These videos are equipped with sign language interpreters at the edge of the screen and text below the video to help deaf people understand the material. In addition, we apply Evidence-based study strategies are learning strategies supported by scientific evidence. These strategies have been proven effective in helping students and other individuals learn more effectively and remember information more effectively. In this application, active recall is applied by providing quizzes that can help deaf people remember and understand the material presented in the video. These quizzes can be accessed anytime and anywhere, so deaf people can learn more flexibly.
We created this application to help deaf people develop the hard and soft skills they need to enter the workforce.

We believe that this application has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of deaf people. By providing them with access to educational resources and evidence-based study strategies, we can help them to achieve their full potential.
